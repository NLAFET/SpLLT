Please, take a look at Dgemm_bench.sh for an example of ESSL usage with GNU Fortran on Panther.

TODO: Is GNU OpenMP library ABI compatible with IBM OpenMP?
Can a program with OpenMP directives be:
a) Compiled with GNU and linked to libxlsmp?
b) Compiled with XL and linked to libgomp?

Ad a):
Given "foo.f" that contains OpenMP directives,
gfortran -fopenmp foo.f -c
gfortran foo.o -Wl,-rpath=/gpfs/panther/local/apps/ibm/lib -L/gpfs/panther/local/apps/ibm/xlsmp/4.1.5/lib -lxlsmp
Should compile it with GNU Fortran and link it with IBM XL OpenMP library.
